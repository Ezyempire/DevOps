The University of Ghana is a public university located in Accra,[3] Ghana. It is the oldest public university in Ghana.

The university was founded in 1948 [4] as the University College of the Gold Coast[5][6] in the British colony of the Gold Coast. It was originally an affiliate college of the University of London,[7] which supervised its academic programs and awarded degrees.[8] After Ghana gained independence in 1957, the college was renamed the University College of Ghana.[9] It changed it name again to the University of Ghana in 1961, when it gained full university status.[10]

The University of Ghana is situated on the west side of the Accra Legon Hills and northeast of the centre of Accra. It has over 60,000 registered students.[7]

Introduction
The original emphasis on establishing the University of Ghana was on the liberal arts, social sciences, law, basic science, agriculture, and medicine. [11] However, as part of a national educational reform program, the university's curriculum was expanded to provide more technology-based and vocational courses as well as postgraduate training.[12]

The University of Ghana, which is mainly based in Legon, about 12 kilometres northeast of the center of Accra, has its medical school in the town of Korle-Bu, with a teaching hospital and a secondary/external campus in the city of Accra.[12] It also has a graduate school of nuclear and allied Sciences at the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission,[13] making it one of the few universities in Africa offering programs in nuclear physics and nuclear engineering. [11]

The University of Ghana Logo
University of Ghana Logo
University of Ghana Logo[14]
The logo is made up of two colors: Indigo Dye and Camel.[14] The blue shield with three "AYA" standing upright in top half and "DWENINMENTOASO" in the middle of bottom half, all embossed in gold.[15] The logo was designed by A. M. Opoku.[16] "AYA" (Akan word for fern) is an Adinkra symbol.[17] The "AYA" grows straight and it is used here to represent truthfulness and an ability to stay upright.

Ram's Horns: 'Dweninmen' (Akan word for Ram's Horn) is an Adinkra symbol.[18] Here, two interlocking ram's horns (DWENINMENTOASO) have been used to symbolise strength and a call to pursue a path of integrity.[18] The University of Ghana was granted degree-awarding status in 1961.

History
The formation of the West African Commission of the Asquith Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies[19] under the chairmanship of Rt. Hon. Walter Elliot was the birth of this notable institution in 1948.[20] The commission recommended the setting up of university colleges in association with the University of London, thus the University College of the Gold Coast was founded by Ordinance on 11 August 1948 for the purpose of providing for and promoting university education, learning and research.[20] This was made possible by the rejection of the first recommendation which stated that only one university college was feasible for the whole of British West Africa, which would be located in Nigeria by the people of Gold Coast.

In the book commissioned by the University of Ghana, Professor Francis Agbodeka (1998) found that "Two members of the Legislative Council on their own volition worked on the question of securing funds for the project. More significant, F. M. Bourret (1949), in almost a contemporaneous account, reported that the strong and united opinion expressed by Dr. Nanka-Bruce in a Radio Station Zoy address to the People of the Gold Coast in October 1947, “was largely instrumental in influencing the Secretary of State for the colonies” to finally give his consent in 1947, “for the establishment of a Gold Coast university college.” [21]

Long before the advent of television, entire communities and groups would listen to news, sports, and entertainment, broadcast from Radio Station Zoy, the BBC, and other stations on the short wave radio band, to a single radio set.

Significantly, the establishment of the University of Ghana, based on the Elliot Commission's Majority Report (of which Sir Arku Korsah of the Gold Coast was a member), was the culmination of immense work of several organizations, committees, institutions, and prominent individuals, at home and abroad. Among some of the most prominent Ghanaians, members of organizations and civil society groups that campaigned for the establishment of the University of College of the Gold Coast/Ghana, included also Dr. Nanka-Bruce, Rev. Prof. C. G. Baeta, and Sir E. Asafu-Adjaye, Dr. J. B. Danquah, included. The Asantehene, Otomfuo Nana Agyemang Prempeh, II, agreed to the proposition after the Elliot Commission proposed establishment of a university in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region. In sum, the Gold Coast citizenry, as a collective, successfully advocated for the establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast in association with the University of London, in 1948, after the Elliot Commission report, on which Sir Arku Korsah of the Gold Coast sat.

In 1961 the Government of Ghana under Kwame Nkrumah passed the University of Ghana Act, 1961 (Act 79) to replace the then University College of Ghana. Through that act, the university attained sovereign university status and mandate to award its own degrees.[22]

There are also flats and guest rooms for senior members and guests. There are main halls of residence by the Government of Ghana and private halls of residence built on campus by individuals and corporate bodies.[48][47] Below are descriptions of the halls of residence; Commonwealth Hall, Legon Hall, Mensah Sarbah Hall, Volta Hall, Akuafo Hall and Jubilee Hall at the University of Ghana, Legon.

Commonwealth Hall (the university's only male hall of residence). Known as the Vandals, the word VANDALS is an acronym for Vivacious, Affable, Neighborly, Devoted, Altruistic and Loyal. The students of Commonwealth Hall recognize themselves by calling out the word 'V-Mate' with a response word 'Sharp'. Often clad in red, as the colour of their identity, VANDALs pride themselves with unity.[49]
Legon Hall (The Legon Hall is the premier hall of the University of Ghana). Legon Hall was the first hall of residence to be considered and built on the University of Ghana campus, thus referred to as the Premier Hall. The Hall is located at the Centre of the school close to the biggest library (the Balme Library) in the West African region. Just like the Mensah Sarbah Hall and the Akuafo Hall, Legon Hall serves as home for both male and female students, allowing for strong bonds between the sexes on the campus.[50] The motto of the Legon hall is; "Cui Multidum Datum", which means "human relations with examples".[51]
Mensah Sarbah Hall (The Mensah Sarbah Hall is the first hall to be named after a hero of the nation; Dr. Mensah Sarbah). The hall is recognised to host most of the best athletes on the university's campus.
Volta Hall (the university's female-only hall of residence). It is the only all-female hall on campus known for their discipline and neatness. The hall has churned out many respectable women such as the first female Chief Justice Georgina Theodora Woode.
Akuafo Hall The word "akuafo" is an Akan word which means farmers. For this reason the hall is notably called the Farmers hall with a rich Ghanaian culture and tradition. The Akuafo Hall was the second hall of residence to be established in the University of Ghana. Their chieftaincy institution serves as a symbol of unity for students and also helps to promote and showcase the rich Ghanaian culture. The chief farmer and his queen mother are elected annually[citation needed].
Jubilee Hall. The Jubilee Hall is one of the halls of residence of the University of Ghana, Legon. The Jubilee hall is located on the south of the university campus, and opposite to the International Students Hostel. Jubilee Hall was built to commemorate the university's Golden Jubilee celebration in 1998. The hall was mainly built through support funds from alumni of the university.[52]
The university has eight newly created halls of residence that were commissioned in 2011. They are:

Alexander Kwapong Hall, named after Professor Alexander Kwapong a former Vice-Chancellor and Chairman of the Council of State.[53]
Jean Nelson Akah Hall, named after an alumnus, Jean Nelson Akah. It was inaugurated in July 2010. Its emblem shows a candle, a book and a pen to symbolize perseverance. It was designed by a final year Physics-Computer Science major student Raymond Sung-Seh Harrison. The motto of the hall, "Lux in Tenebris", which is Latin for "Light in Darkness", was suggested by Raymond's mate at the time, a lady by the name Muna Twerefour. The emblem was officially adopted on Tuesday, 2 April 2013.
Hilla Limann Hall, the first of the University of Ghana Enterprise Limited (UGEL) hostels to be completed. It was inaugurated in July 2010,[54] during which the Vice-Chancellor announced the decision to name it after Dr. Hilla Limann, a former President of the Republic of Ghana. Senior members of the university may be assigned as Fellows of the Hall by the Vice Chancellor. Students assigned/affiliated to the Hall form the Junior members. The Head of the Hall, Senior Tutor and fellow tutors serve as a body which helps with the governing of the Hall.

The management of the university was labeled as 'insensitive' to the hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic after the school increased its facility user fees for 2020/21 academic year. It led to a protest on social media and the decision was later reversed.[65] In recent years there has been reports of sexual misconduct levelled against several lectures at the university which the university denied. An investigative documentary was produced by former victims of the sexual harassment which was uploaded to YouTube.[66][67][68]
